## About me
___
My name is Liubov Fedotova. I have recently started a career journey to become a software tester. I've been interested in this career for a long time, so I'm excited to get the chance to prove my skills. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by myself and by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.<br/>
Thanks to my experience as a public servant, I've gained good communication skills and know how to work under tight deadlines. I'm attention to detail, have critical thinking, analytical abilities and a drive to learn.

In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior or trainee position in testing.
